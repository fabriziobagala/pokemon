Pokemon is a REST API that given the name of a Pokemon returns its description in Shakespearean style.

## Prerequisites

On your machine must be installed:

- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) is a full-featured IDE to code, debug, test, and deploy to any platform.
- [.NET Core 3.1.402](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) is a cross-platform version of .NET for building websites, services, and console apps.
- [Postman 7.32](https://www.postman.com/) is a collaboration platform for API development.
- [Node.js 14.11](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [Newman 5.2.0](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/#:~:text=Newman%20is%20a%20command%20line,integration%20servers%20and%20build%20systems.) is a command line Collection Runner for Postman.
- [HTTPie 2.2.0](https://httpie.org/) is a user-friendly command-line HTTP client for the API era.

## Third-Party Libraries

The solution uses the following [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/) packages:
- [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) is a popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET.
- [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) provides diagnostic logging to files, the console, and elsewhere.
- [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq4) is the most popular and friendly mocking library for .NET.

## Usage

Open the solution with Visual Studio.
<br />
Launch the application and wait for the default browser to open with the following URL:

    http://localhost:5000/pokemon

If you see "All is OK", the application has started correctly; otherwise, consult the log file inside the Logs folder to check the issue.

Open the terminal and type the following command:

    http http://localhost:5000/pokemon/charizard
